    <p>On February 7, 2013, Timor-Leste launched the nation's first 'No Take Zones' (NTZs), where fishing restrictions and other protective measures have been put in place to enable the replenishment of fish stocks and the protection of coral reefs that support local people. The protective measures are aimed at conserving the as-yet unrealized value of Timor-Leste's marine-based natural capital, which is essential for the food security and economic development of one of the world's newest and elast developed countries. </p>
    <p>The announcement of these zones was made by the Timor-Leste Secretary of State for Fisheries, Rafael Periera Goncalves, in an event held in Com, a coastal community five hours from the capital of Dili. The event was attended by Judith Fergin, Timor-Leste's U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Rick Scott, USAID Mission Director, senior officials from the Timor-Leste Government and community leaders, in demonstration of the joint commitment which has brought about these important management improvements. </p>
    <p>The seven 'No Take Zones' are embedded within broader multiple-use marine protected areas, covering 207 square kilometers of coastal waters of the Island nation's only National Park. The zones encompass important coral reefs which help maximize climate resilience, serve as reef fish spawning sites, enable fisheries replenishment and protect key dive and snorkel sites for tourism purposes. The 'No Take Zones' will be enforced through a co-management approach between local, district and national fisheries authorities.</p>
    <p>Secretary Goncalves said, 'We appreciate the interest in the development of the fisheries sector in Timor-Leste, which plays an important role in the prevention of malnutrition, food security and livelihoods of fishermen and people of Timor-Leste.</p>
    <p>The launch of the No Take Zones holds great promise for the future of Timor-Leste's marine environments and the contribution they can make to artisanal fisheries, local livelihoods and economic development. A well managed coastal ecosystem is extremely valuable. It can provide a sustainable supply of seafood, is critical for marine tourism, and increases the resilience of local communities to the pressures of climate change by ensuring diversified livelihood options.</p>
