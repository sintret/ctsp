    <hr/>
    <p>This body of work has yet to commence. Support is needed to work with the Ministry of Tourism and Culture to develop the nature-based 
    tourism industry in such a way that it enables sustainable management of coastal and marine resources. 
    The growth of the tourism sector is marked as an economic development priority in the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan. 
    One fo the key recommendations from a marine biodiversity survey conducted in August 2012 was for the development of a 'Marine Tourism Master Plan' :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Recommendation 6: Consider drafting a marine tourism master plan.</strong> Timor-Leste has excellent potential to further develop its marine tourism industry. 
        While the current marine tourism hub for the nation is focused around Dili, the smaller-scale tourism development now focusing 
        on the reefs areas around Com and Pulau Jako within the NKSNP and on Atauro Island should be nurtured by the government 
        and provided clear direction and incentives to ensure that they develop in an environmentally-sustainable manner that 
        provides clear benefits to local communities. The government should strongly consider drafting a marine tourism master plan 
        that provides clear regulations on environmentally-friendly accommodation construction and waste management, 
        as well as stipulations to ensure that local communities derive clear benefits (by requiring, for instance, 
        a minimum percentage of resort staff to be hired from local communities, etc). The master plan should 
        carefully consider and strive to harmonize development of both community-run homestays as well as more capital-intensive dive resorts, 
        and should set a clear "tourism carrying capacity" that limits the number of operating licenses. As noted previously, 
        the master plan should also include the development of a marine tourism entrance fee system that is used to fund both 
        MPA management and community improvement programs as has been done effectively in a number of well-established Coral Triangle MPAs.
